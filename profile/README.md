Making applications that work but with code that is not optimized at all

*tizuWare is currently WIP. This message will be removed once the tAppStore will be released.*

**Everything mentioned below might change at any point in time without further notice**

## Your privacy (Privacy Policy)
No real magic here. We do not store any data unless you don't follow the agreement above. If we find out that someone secretly stores user data, said person instantly gets blocked from the tizuWare organization. This will prevent said user from...
- opening or commenting on issues or pull requests 
- starring, forking, or watching
- adding or editing wiki pages

... which prevents them from tinkering around with code again to get user data. In addition to that, we revert application code to the old state without data collection as fast as possible. However, no worries. This gets noticed in most cases anyways.

## Lastly, here are some ideas to get you started:
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about? WPF applications.

üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? Just work on something and it'll get accepted or rejected.

üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Nowhere. All over the place. Is there anything else the community should know? No.

üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast? A byte-size meal
