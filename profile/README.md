Making applications that work but with code that is not optimized at all
## Your privacy (Privacy Policy)
No real magic here. We do not store any data. If we find out that someone secretly stores user data, said person instantly gets blocked from the tizuWare organization. This will prevent said user from...
> opening or commenting on issues or pull requests
> 
> starring, forking, or watching
>
> adding or editing wiki pages

... which prevents them from tinkering around with code again to get user data. In addition to that, we revert application code to the old state without data collection as fast as possible. If you notice something suspicious about your tizuWare app(s) after an update, simply do not use it unless there is a message stating what changed in [our Telegram channel](https://t.me/tizuWare). Since only I, the owner, have access to that group, you can't tinker around with it to try and let the users start some tizuWare app.

## Lastly, here are some ideas to get you started:
🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about? WPF applications.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? If you worked so hard on something, you can push request it. It will get accepted or rejected. No in-between.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Nowhere. All over the place. Is there anything else the community should know? No.

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast? A byte-size meal
