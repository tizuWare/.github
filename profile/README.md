Making applications that work but with code that is not optimized at all

**Everything mentioned below might change at any point in time without further notice**
## Note!
By using any tizuWare application or service, you agree to using said product only for legal purposes according to laws of your country. If we find out that you ignore this, we may...
- prevent you from using the tAppStore.
- block you on all of our GitHub projects.
- take legal action in serious breach of law(s).
- take other actions not listed here if required.

If you find out that someone may violate those rules, create an issue [here](https://github.com/tizuWare/violation-log/issues).

## Your privacy (Privacy Policy)
No real magic here. We do not store any data unless you don't follow the agreement above. If we find out that someone secretly stores user data, said person instantly gets blocked from the tizuWare organization. This will prevent said user from...
- opening or commenting on issues or pull requests 
- starring, forking, or watching
- adding or editing wiki pages

... which prevents them from tinkering around with code again to get user data. In addition to that, we revert application code to the old state without data collection as fast as possible. If you notice something suspicious about your tizuWare app(s) after an update, simply do not use it unless there is a message stating what changed in [our Telegram channel](https://t.me/tizuWare). Since only I, the owner, have access to that group, you can't tinker around with it to try and let the users start some tizuWare app.
