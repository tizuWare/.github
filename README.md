Making applications that work but with code that is not optimized at all
## Your privacy (Privacy Policy)
No real magic here. We do not store any data. If we find out that someone secretly stores user data, said person instantly gets blocked from the tizuWare organization. This will prevent said user from...
> opening or commenting on issues or pull requests
starring, forking, or watching
adding or editing wiki pages

... which prevents them from tinkering around with code again to get user data. In addition to that, we revert application code to the old state without data collection as fast as possible. If you notice something suspicious about your tizuWare app(s) after an update, simply do not use it unless there is a message stating what changed in [our Telegram channel](https://t.me/tizuWare). Since only I, the owner, have access to that group, you can't tinker around with it to try and let the users start some tizuWare app.
